## Day 7: Phylogenomics
Today you are going to learn how to use complete genomes to reconstruct the groups phylogeny, to evaluate genealogical discordances and explore the role of hybridization in group's history. We're going to use as example the data from [Figueiró et al., 2017](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700299).

### Phylogenetic inference based on whole-genome sequences
### Genealogical discordance in genome-wide datasets
### Inference of historical hybridization among lineages

## Day 8: Adaptive evolution and demographic history
Today you are going to learn how to perform analyses of natural selection on complete genomes and how to infer historical demography. We're going to use as example the data from [Figueiró et al., 2017](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.1700299).

### Investigating adaptive evolution based on genome-wide datasets
### Inference of historical demography: PSMC as an example

## Day 9: Population Genomics
Today you are going to learn how to perform basic populational analyses using complete genomes at low depth, including calling, diversity and homozygosity estimates, population structure and admixture. We're going to use as example the data from [Pecnerova et al., 2021](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2021.01.064).

### SNP calling vs. genotype likelihoods
### Estimates of genome-wide diversity
### Estimates of population structure and admixture
### Estimates of Runs of Homozygosity
