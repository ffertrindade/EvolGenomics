## 3-1 Phylogenomics
Today you are going to learn how to use complete genomes to reconstruct the phylogeny of several species, to evaluate genealogical discordance among genomic segments, and to explore the role of hybridization in the group's history. We're going to use as an example the data on wild cats reported by [Li et al., 2019](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/36/10/2111/5518928).

### Construct genomic windows
### Phylogenetic inference based on whole-genome sequences
